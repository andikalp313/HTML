<h1>HTML</h1>
<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b> is the standard<a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/7/79/Chapter_598.png/revision/latest?cb=20161008115046">  markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
