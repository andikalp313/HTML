            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b> is the standard<a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/7/79/Chapter_598.png/revision/latest?cb=20161008115046">  markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

            <h2>HISTORY</h2>

            <h3><b>Development</b></h3>
            <p>In 1980,<a href="facebook.com">physicist Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at<a> CERN</a>,proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</p>

            HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
